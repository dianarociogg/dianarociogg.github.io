## Portfolio

I am a cadastral engineer and geodesist keen on developing business analysis and data science projects. I have always been interested in applying modelling techniques to solve real-world problems and provide insights into decision-making processes. I have had the opportunity to work in multidisciplinary teams on projects related to georeferenced data along its value chain. Currently, I am a master's student in data science, updating and expanding my IT and computing service-oriented knowledge.

### [Applied research and innovation projects for geospatial data management](/idi_projects)

My background comes from geospatial data (vector and raster), statistical data and its integration with alternative sources in applied research and innovation projects. It implies the understanding and application of different techniques for data analysis using statistical methods, machine Learning and AI algorithms.

### Production and analysis of georeferenced data

But before making data science and on a daily basis in my career, I am always involved in retrieving, collecting, structuring and visualizing geographic data, also known as geospatial, geolocated, georeferenced, or location-based data. These are some examples:


- [Geopandas analysis](https://github.com/drgalindog/dianarocioprojects/tree/main/Python)
- [R dashboard with map](https://github.com/drgalindog/dianarocioprojects/tree/main/R)
- [Some map thumbnails collection](/images/thumbnail_2.jpg)

### Data reduction, segmentation, classification, prediction and visualization

Here, are some of the projects where I have worked with where the main objective is not focused on the geospatial side of the data, I love to cluster/segmentation, classify and predict.
