## Welcome to my GitHub

My name is Diana; I am a engineer currently focused on projects involving business analytics, data management, and data science. I have worked since 2006 with data, mainly in the geographic context, but I have also oriented my career to analysing data from different fields and subjects; my experience includes statistical, machine learning, and neural network analysis and modeling. Some of my project codes are available on various repositories, but I cannot share all of my work due to confidentiality agreements. For more information about my experience and qualifications.  If you need references or further information, please contact me directly.
