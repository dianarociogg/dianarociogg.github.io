## Welcome to my GitHub

My name is Diana; I am a Colombian Engineer currently focused on projects involving business analytics, data management, and data science. I have worked since 2006 with data, mainly in the geographic context, but I have also oriented my career to analyzing data from different fields and subjects; my experience includes statistical, machine learning, and neural network analysis and modeling. I am completing my MSc in data science to further develop my data engineering and IT projects design skills and stay current on analysis methods. Some of my project codes are available on various repositories, but I cannot share all of my work due to confidentiality agreements. You can view my CV on this website for more information about my experience and qualifications.  If you need references or further information, please contact me directly.
