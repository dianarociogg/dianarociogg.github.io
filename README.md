## Welcome to my GitHub account

My name is Diana, I am a Colombian Cadastral Engineer also geodesist, currently interested in developing business analytics, data science, and data management projects. I feel passionate about applying modelling techniques to support decision-making in the real world and delivering valuable insights for different stakeholders.

I am passionate about working with data, and my background has given me a strong proficiency with spatial data. I also have had the opportunity to work with data from different areas allowing to strenght my capabilities in data sources integration and explotation in innovation and applied research projects. This involves understanding and applying various data analysis and inference techniques, including statistical methods, machine learning, and AI algorithms, to solve challenges related to the exploitation of georeferenced data for decision-making and, in general, associated with geospatial data throughout its value chain. Also, working in multidisciplinary teams, I have enriched my human and personal dimension.


Currently, I am an MSc student in data science keen on developing business analytics and data management projects to broaden my knowledge in data science from an IT services and informatics perspective. You can find more detailed information about my training and experience in a copy of my current CV. Also, you can find some of my codes for the projects I have worked with available on various repositories.
