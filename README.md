## Welcome to my GitHub

I am a engineer currently focused on projects involving end-to-end data exploitation projects. I have worked since 2006 with data oriented to location-based analysis; my experience includes statistical, machine learning, and neural network analysis and modeling. Some of my project codes are available on the repositories, not all mainly due to confidentiality agreements. For more information about my experience or further information, please contact me directly.
